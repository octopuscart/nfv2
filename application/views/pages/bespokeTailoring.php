                    <p class="fw_light m_bottom_10">
                        <span class="paragraphscpace"></span>The concept of Bespoke Tailoring originated on Savile Row, London in the early 18th century, where royalty and aristocrats became increasingly obsessed by how clothing portrayed their wealth and status. In order to fulfill their sartorial desires, they worked with the most experienced tailors who had access to the finest cloths. Once a client had selected a specific fabric, it would be ‘bespoken for’, meaning that it now become exclusive to the client.                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw_light m_bottom_10">
                        As these tailors built a following, each of them became known for their different styles, silhouettes and finishing details (known as the house cutting style).                  
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw_light m_bottom_10">
                        In today’s world of bespoke tailoring, you can expect for your clothing to be made with the same precise techniques used in the decades before. They are still crafted by hand and require hours of dedication, that no machine can ever replicate.

                    <p class="fw_light m_bottom_10">
                        The journey you take to creating your bespoke garment is rather exclusive. It begins with a series of questions to discover what your wardrobe heart desires. Our expert stylists will showcase various fabric and style choices based on your requirements and advise which patterns and colours to lean towards and steer away from. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw_light m_bottom_10">
                        With your bespoke suit, you can manipulate the lapel style and size, the degree of shoulder padding and canvassing, the style of your pockets, buttons, vibrant interior linings and more. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw_light m_bottom_10">
                        The features that you can tweak on your bespoke shirt include the collar and cuff style, degree of collar and cuff stiffness, pockets, monogramming, buttons, gussets, accenting and more.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw_light m_bottom_10">
                        Using the same unchanging, traditional techniques we take around 30-40 measurements, and take note of your individual posture and figure. Every individual has a different shoulder slope, stance and some degree of asymmetry from the left side and the right side of their body. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw_light m_bottom_10">
                        Like a fingerprint, no two paper patterns are identical. Using these exciting figuration details, our highly skilled tailor sets off to make the chalk marking on your garment.  Next they start to cut the fabric along the markings and loosely sews the luxury garment together in preparation for your baste fitting.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw_light m_bottom_10">
                        At this point you will have a half ready garment to try on, and are able to make as many alterations as you desire to reach that perfection of fit. The final garment takes about 5-6 weeks to complete. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="fw_light m_bottom_10">
                        Just like learning a new subject at university, every time you visit Nita Fashions you will learn something new about sartorial trends and what else you can add to highlight your individual style. Once you commence your bespoke journey, it’s a never-ending addiction.
